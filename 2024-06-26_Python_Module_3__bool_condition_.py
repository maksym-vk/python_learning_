# More complicated comparison
# Read three numbers
number1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
number3 = int(input("Enter the third number: "))

# We temporarily assume that the first number
# is the largest one.
# We will verify this soon.
largest_number = number1

# We check if the second number is larger than the current largest_number
# and update the largest_number if needed.
if number2 > largest_number:
    largest_number = number2

# We check if the third number is larger than the current largest_number
# and update the largest_number if needed.
if number3 > largest_number:
    largest_number = number3

# Print the result
print("The largest number is:", largest_number)
#
# Why if and not elif
#
#     Independent Checks:
#         The checks for number2 and number3 being larger than largest_number are independent
#         of each other.
#         This means that after updating largest_number with number2, you still need to check
#         if number3 is larger than the updated largest_number.
#
#     Sequential Comparison:
#         Initially, largest_number is set to number1.
#         The first if statement checks if number2 is larger than largest_number
#         (which is number1 at this point). If true, largest_number is updated to number2.
#         The second if statement then checks if number3 is larger than the current
#         largest_number (which could be number1 or number2 depending on the first check).
#         If true, largest_number is updated to number3.
#
# Why Not elif
#
#     elif (else if) implies a mutually exclusive condition that is checked only if
#     the preceding if (or elif) condition is False.
#     If you used elif here, the second condition would only be checked if
#     the first condition (number2 > largest_number) is False. This would mean that
#     number3 is only compared to number1 and not to a potentially updated largest_number.
#
# Correct Logic with if
#
# Using if for both conditions ensures each number is compared independently
# to the current largest value, guaranteeing the correct largest number is identified.
#
# Thus, the correct approach is to use two if statements to ensure each number
# has the opportunity to be the largest number after each comparison.


# Alternative solution
# Read three numbers
number1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
number3 = int(input("Enter the third number: "))

# Determine the largest number using nested if-else statements
if number1 >= number2:
    if number1 >= number3:
        largest_number = number1
    else:
        largest_number = number3
else:
    if number2 >= number3:
        largest_number = number2
    else:
        largest_number = number3

# Print the result
print("The largest number is:", largest_number)
